For this workshop we will be using GitHub and iPython notebooks

We will be using iPython notebooks. A great description of this platform was written up recently in Nature: http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261

No programming experience is necessary we will be providing templates for you to step through and modify.

First Step:
Go to https://github.com and make an account

Second Step:
you’ll need to setup python/iPython and some additional packages on your computer.
Here is an easy way to do that:

First Install the (free) Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ (this includes python, iPython notebooks and most of mathematical/scientific packages needed) 
Next we need to install some additional packages that are used in the tutorials, we will do that from the command line.
Open a terminal and install the packages with the following commands:
...
pip install astroquery
pip install pyWWT
conda install seaborn
...
Great you are ready to go! To start the notebook type “ipython notebook” on the command line.
Now you are ready to load the notebooks for that we will be using for the tutorials, you can get them here:
