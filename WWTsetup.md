# Getting set up for the GLPA OpenWWT workshop

### If you want to follow along with the main WWT activities do this
Install the latest version of [WWT](http://worldwidetelescope.org/Download/)
 
### If you want to follow with the python/WWT tutorials
If you are just starting out with python I strongly recommend using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics. Anaconda installs most of the packages needed for scientific computing with python (astropy is included with Anaconda, unfortunately you have to install [astroquery](http://www.astropy.org/astroquery/) and [pyWWT](http://www.jzuhone.com/pywwt/) yourself)

### If you want to become a WWT developer
1.  Get a [GitHub](http://github.org) account
2.  Install [Visual Studio Community Edition 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx)
2.  Fork [this project](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-windows-client)
