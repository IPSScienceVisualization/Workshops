    "# 4. Generating intensity maps form Gaia's data\n",
    "This section is the main part of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculation of the mean intensity\n",
    "To make a Milky Way texture map is to make a mean light intensity map constructed from the star light in any direction. Although the 'spherical map' or 'equirectangular map' is popular for texture mapping, we don't use it here because it has singularities at poles. Instead, we use the 'cube map'. We observe stars at the center of the cube ('O'). Each plane of the cube is divided into small cells, and each cell plays a role of an imaging sensor for observing the starlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculating the mean intensity map, each cell accumulates the intensities of the incident rays, or brightness, from stars,\n",
    "where each ray connects a star and the observing point O.\n",
    "Consider a cell and writing the sum of the intensities of the rays entering the cell as $\\sum_i I_i$, the mean intensity in the direction of the cell as seen from O, $\\bar{I}$, is defined as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_i I_i = \\bar{I} \\Delta \\Omega\n",
    "$$\n",
    "or more directly\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{I} = \\sum_i I_i \\ / \\ \\Delta \\Omega,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\Delta \\Omega$ is the solid angle of the cell observed from the center O.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the area of the cells are equal. However, their solid angle $\\Delta \\Omega$ can be different depending on its position on the plane. For the cubic configuration, the cell at the center of the plane is the nearest to the cubic center O and the line that connects it and O is parallel to the normal vector of the plane. Let its solid angle be $\\Delta \\Omega_0$. For an off-center cell, its solid angle $\\Delta \\Omega$ is written as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta \\Omega = \\Delta \\Omega_0 \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{l_0}{l} \\right)^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle between the (outward) normal vector of the plane and the direction of the cell as seen from the cubic center O. Thus, the factor $\\cos\\theta$ means the effect of the orientaion of the cell with respect to the cubic center O. The factor $(l_0/l)^2$ reflects the distance between the cell and the cubic center O, where $l$ and $l_0$ are the distances between the cubic center O and the cell and the center cell, respectively. Since the former factor can be rewritten as $\\cos\\theta = (l_0/l)$, the above equation becomes:\n",

    "\\Delta \\Omega = \\Delta \\Omega_0 \\left( \\frac{l_0}{l} \\right)^3,\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Now, consider a cube 2 units on each side. In this case, $l_0 = 1$. Considering one of the planes and defining the $x-y$ plane on the plane with its origin at the center of the plane, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are in the ranges $-1<x<1$ and $-1<y<1$. The distance between the cell at $(x, y)$ on the plane and the cubic center O, $l$, is given by $l = (1 + x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}$ and we have\n",

    "\\bar{I} = \\sum_i I_i \\ (1 + x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} \\ /\\ \\Delta \\Omega_0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see in the next section, the calculated mean intensity is to be multiplified by an arbitrary factor in order to adjust the brightness of the output images. Therefore, we can choose the unit of the intensity arbitrarily. Here, we set it so that the factor $1/\\Delta \\Omega_0$ is cancelled out to make the expressions as simple as possible. Thus, finally we obtain the formula to calculate the mean intensity for the cell at $(x,y)$:\n",
