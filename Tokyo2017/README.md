# So you'd like to visualize some data in the Iziko Planetarium and Digital Dome...

The [Iziko Planetarium and Digital Dome](https://www.iziko.org.za/museums/planetarium) is the most advanced digital planetarium on the African continent. In addittion to being used for public planetarium shows it also servers to optimise South Africaâ€™s eResearch and data visualisation capacity. This planetarium blends together 6 4K projectors, driven by a cluster of 12 computers (14 including the GUI machine and the audio computer). Each of these computers suppoets a state-of-the-art Pascal 6000 graphics card with 24GB or memory. The planetarium actually has two of these computer clusters, one that is used for public planetarium operations and one for its eResearch operations.


There are two main pathways for creating visualization
* Tutorial 2: [Volumetric Domemaster Rendering with yt](https://github.com/IPSScienceVisualization/Workshops/blob/master/Tokyo2017/Volumetric%20Fisheye%20Rendering%20with%20yt.ipynb)  

The Uniview bundle demoing the programmable graphics shaders is available in this repository as well.

If you are unable to get the programming environment set up locally, you can run the code remotely here: [jupyter.adlerplanetarium.org](http://jupyter.adlerplanetarium.org). This was set up for the workshop and I make no promises on how long this link will be live.
